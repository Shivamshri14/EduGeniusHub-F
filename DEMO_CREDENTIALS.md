## Create Demo Customer Account

Since Supabase auth requires actual signup, here's how to quickly create a demo customer:

### Option 1: Quick Register (30 seconds)

1. Open **Incognito/Private browser window**
2. Go to http://localhost:3000
3. Click **"Register"**
4. Fill in:
   - **Phone**: `9999888877` or `+919999888877`
   - **Email**: `customer@demo.com`
   - **Password**: `demo123456`
   - **Confirm Password**: `demo123456`
5. Click **"Create Account"**
6. Done! Now you can login as customer

### Option 2: Use SQL After Manual Registration

After you register via the app, run this in Supabase SQL Editor to give the customer a subscription:

```sql
-- Get the customer's user ID (replace email if different)
WITH customer_profile AS (
  SELECT id FROM profiles WHERE email = 'customer@demo.com'
)
-- Create customer record
INSERT INTO customers (full_name, phone, email, notes, profile_id)
SELECT
  'Demo Customer',
  '+919999888877',
  'customer@demo.com',
  'Demo account with Netflix subscription',
  id
FROM customer_profile
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING
RETURNING *;

-- Create subscription for the customer
WITH customer_record AS (
  SELECT id FROM customers WHERE email = 'customer@demo.com'
),
netflix_plan AS (
  SELECT id FROM plans WHERE display_name = 'Netflix Private Plan' LIMIT 1
)
INSERT INTO subscriptions (customer_id, plan_id, start_date, end_date, status)
SELECT
  customer_record.id,
  netflix_plan.id,
  CURRENT_DATE,
  CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '30 days',
  'active'
FROM customer_record, netflix_plan
RETURNING *;

-- Add credentials for the subscription
WITH latest_subscription AS (
  SELECT s.id
  FROM subscriptions s
  JOIN customers c ON c.id = s.customer_id
  WHERE c.email = 'customer@demo.com'
  ORDER BY s.created_at DESC
  LIMIT 1
)
INSERT INTO credentials (subscription_id, login_id, password, notes)
SELECT
  id,
  'demo.netflix@example.com',
  'NetflixDemo2024',
  'Private Netflix account - Premium 4K plan'
FROM latest_subscription
RETURNING *;
```
